  <summary>A desktop/gui font family for integrated use with the KDE desktop</summary>

  <description>
    <p>
      Oxygen is a font designed for a desktop/gui. It was built to be used with the KDE desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aim of this font project is to produce a family of freetype-specific desktop fonts whose
      appearance will stay uniform under different screen render settings, unlike more
      traditionally designed 'screen fonts' that have tended to be designed
      for best legibility on the Windows GDI render engine.
